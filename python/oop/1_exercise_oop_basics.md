## Recap: Object oriented programmin in Python
Checkout the code in `/recap`

- Change the class `Eneco` to easily be able to create Eneco with given list of Customers, Employees, and WindTurbines
- Change the string representation of Eneco to print statistics on the amount of Customers, Employees, and WindTurbine Eneco has
- Create an instance of Eneco that contains 20 Employees, 100 WindTurbine, and 3000 Customers and print these statistics
- Alter the `Employee` class such that a new Employee always has a default start_date of today.
- Write a method in the `Employee` class to ask for a raise, and implement a private method that sets the new salary 
- Write class `Generator` and make the class `WindTurbine` inherit it
- Call a method from `Generator` on a wind_turbine object
- Set an instance variable of `Generator` using the `WindTurbine` constructor
- Implement the `WindFarmOwner` or `EnergyProvider` abstract class in the `Eneco` class
