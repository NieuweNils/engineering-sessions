## Dataclasses in Python
Checkout the code in `/dataclass`

- rewrite the `WindTurbine` class to use the dataclass library
- Add your `Generator` as a base class for `WindTurbine` (optional: also refactor that using dataclasses)  

See https://realpython.com/python-data-classes/#inheritance for a LOT more that you can do with dataclasses.
