# APIs

An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. 
It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software.[1] A document or standard that 
describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification. A computer system that 
meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the 
implementation. Whereas a system's user interface dictates how its end-users interact with the system in question, 
its API dictates how to write code that takes advantage of that system's capabilities.
